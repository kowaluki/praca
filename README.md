# Praca - my own project on github.com

Hello World!  This is my first seriously project on github.com for my first future job. My name is ≈Åukasz Kowalski and i will present you my first MVC app created in PHP.


# at the begging...

I am begginer at that, so please - be nice :)  I plan that this application will be used to calculate calculations for customers through the company. It will works also for sign in **( two-factor)**, sign up by a companies, creating users, and many many others :)

## First steps: REST API

### Basic website file calls

We need basic files in our websites - html, css, js, xml. In my app we will call them as follows:

1. HTML files - `/websites/{html_file_name}`
2. XML files - `/xml/{xml_file_name}`
3. JavaScript files - `/script/{script_file_name}` 
4. CSS stylesheets -`/styles/{style_file_name}`
5. 

In `{file_name}` do not use file extension - we know that scripts
ends in .js and stylesheets ends in .css.

## Contact
For my part, that's all for now. I will update this file regulary in future (i hope so :D)
