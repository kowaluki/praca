# Praca - my own project on github.com

Hello World!  This is my first seriously project on github.com for my first future job. My name is ≈Åukasz Kowalski and i will present you my first MVC app created in PHP.


### at the begging...

I am begginer at that, so please - be nice :)  I plan that this application will be used to calculate calculations for customers through the company. It will works also for sign in **( two-factor)**, sign up by a companies, creating users, and many many others :)

## Technologies

I am using clear PHP code (trying use the newest version ,but... I don't know exactly, propably 8) for back-end (front-end i will describe if i will use that - not now).

## First steps: REST API

### Basic website file calls

We need basic files in our websites - html, css, js, xml. In my app we will call them as follows:

1. HTML files - `/websites/{file_name}`
2. XML files - `/xml/{file_name}`
3. JavaScript files - `/scripts/{file_name}` 
4. CSS stylesheets -`/styles/{file_name}`


In `{file_name}` do not use file extension - we know that scripts
ends in .js and stylesheets ends in .css, and so on...

### We need some modules!
Yes - I created modules, but at the moment just one, menu. How to call that?

`/modules/navigation`

i am gonna to describe this in the next two days, but you can take a look at the examples in index.php

You can load modules on website by, for example, jQuery, like that:

`$("nav").load("modules/navigation")`.

## Activation

I am using that on Apache server on lampp on my notebook on Linux Fedora 36 (workstation), in folders `strony/praca/`.

## Contact
For my part, that's all for now. I will update this file regulary in future (i hope so :D)
